 # 1)About the project
 
## Car Direction Indicators
## Description

Its an automatic and manual car direction indicating system.Based on the steering angle, respective indicator light automatically gets ON/OFF. This automatic signal will be useful when the driver/rider fails to put the indicator while entering the road from parking, during U turn, reversing the vehicle, both the indicator light will be ON (if the driver/rider puts wrong direction indication while turning), when the driver/rider is unable to put the indication during sudden turn.

# 2)Requirements

## i)High Level Requirements
| **ID** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| HLR1 | It shall ON/OFF the indicators by manually operating the switch. |
| HLR2 | It shall ON/OFF the indicators automatically based on the angle of the steering. |

## ii)Low level Requirements

| **HLRID** | **LLRID** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HLR1.1 | LLR1 | It shall switch on the left indicators if the switch is pressed left side.  |
| HLR1.2 | LLR2 | It shall switch on the right indicators if the switch is pressed right side.  |
| HLR1.3 | LLR3 | It shall switch off the indicators if the switch is off.  |
| HLR2.1 | LLR1 | It shall on the left indicators when the angle of the steering is >=135 degrees. |
| HLR2.1 | LLR1 | It shall on the right indicators when the angle of the steering is <=45 degrees. |
| HLR2.2 | LLR2 | It shall off the  indicators when the angle of the steering is >=45 and <=135 degrees. |

# 3)SWOT Analysis:
## Strength:Automatically it gives direction indication lights.
## Weakness:
## Opportunity:It should be implimented in a large scale.
## Threat:
       
# 4)5W's and 1H

## what: 
It's an car direction indicating system.
